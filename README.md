Lyrics Player for FirefoxOS
=========================

A simple MP3 player with the capability of downloading lyrics in LRC format, and displaying them in sync with the song.

**Current features are:**
- MP3 playback with standard playback controls (play/pause/seeking)
- Downloading lyrics from my "server" (see notes below)
- Displaying synchronized lyrics ([LRC format][1])

*You can download the app from the Firefox Marketplace [here][4].*

*Check out the [Android version][5] too!*

**Notes:**
> This application was made as a school project, so expect bugs and occasional weird behaviors. Use with caution!
> Since I couldn't find any good open databases with LRC files I chose to host my own, and populate it with my own collection. Because of this, the amount of files is pretty scarce.
> These files are obtained from the [MiniLyrics][2] database.
> An up to date index of the LRC files can always be found [here][3].
